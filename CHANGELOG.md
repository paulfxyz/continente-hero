### 🐛 Critical fix — `curl | bash` stdin pipe contamination

This patch resolves the root cause of every installation failure reported since v1.3.0: the `curl -fsSL URL | bash` pipe was being contaminated by stdout output from subprocesses (`brew`, `git`, `pip`, `playwright`), causing bash to interpret tool output as commands.

---

#### The bug — technical explanation

When bash is invoked as `curl URL | bash`, it reads its script from **stdin** — the same file descriptor connected to curl's output. This is how the pipe works: curl writes the script, bash reads it.

The problem is that stdin remains "live" throughout the script's execution. Any child process that writes to **stdout** is writing to the same file descriptor that bash is using to read its next commands. Bash then interprets that output as shell code.

`brew install python@3.13` is a prime offender. It outputs:
- Download progress lines (harmless but noisy)
- Path configuration blocks that look like shell commands
- Lines matching the variable names used in our script (`section`, `REPO_URL`, etc.)

The result was non-deterministic: the installer appeared to succeed but skipped critical steps, or it crashed mid-run with errors like `command not found: section`, or the `shop` alias was never written because the alias-writing block had already been "consumed" from stdin.

#### The fix

Every subprocess that writes to stdout now redirects to stderr:

```bash
brew install python@3.13                     >&2
git clone "$REPO_URL" "$CONTINENTE_DIR"      >&2
git reset --hard origin/main                  >&2
pip install -r requirements.txt               >&2
"$VENV_DIR/bin/playwright" install chromium  >&2
```

Stderr (`>&2`) always flows to the terminal — users still see all output. But it does **not** enter the curl pipe. Stdin stays clean for bash to read the actual script.

---

## 🔖 [2.0.0] — 2026-03-23

### 🚀 Major release — interactive menu, multi-config, shell alias

This release introduces a complete workflow overhaul. The primary way to use continente-hero is now the `shop` command — a single alias that opens an interactive menu covering every operation.

---

#### `shop.sh` — new interactive menu launcher

- 🎛️ `feat:` New `shop.sh` — interactive TUI menu with 6 options:
  - **1) Fill my cart** — runs the bot, offers visible/headless choice
  - **2) Save / refresh session** — guided browser login flow
  - **3) Edit shopping list** — opens in best available editor (VS Code → Cursor → Sublime → TextEdit → nano)
  - **4) Switch shopping list** — multi-config management (see below)
  - **5) Update continente-hero** — pulls latest code + refreshes dependencies
  - **6) Quit**
- 🗂️ `feat:` **Multi-config support** — maintain multiple `.yaml` shopping lists in a `configs/` folder, switch between them from the menu. Active list is always `config.yaml`
- 🏷️ `feat:` Active list name shown at the top of every menu screen
- 🏗️ `feat:` Create new lists from within the menu — copies current config as a starting point
- 🛡️ `feat:` venv guard at startup — prints the curl install command if the venv doesn't exist yet
- 🔄 `feat:` Update option uses `git reset --hard origin/main` — never fails due to local modifications

---

#### `setup.sh` — curl installer now fully automatic

- 🤖 `feat:` Python 3.13 is now **installed automatically via Homebrew** when missing — no prompt, no manual step, works when piped through `curl | bash`
- 🏷️ `feat:` Shell alias `shop` registered in `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`) automatically during install
- 🔄 `feat:` Alias update logic — if `shop` alias already exists, it is updated in-place (handles re-installs to a different path)
- 📌 `feat:` Version bumped to v2.0 in the banner

---

#### `update.sh` — rewritten

- 🔄 `fix:` Replaced `git pull` with `git fetch + git reset --hard origin/main` — `git pull` aborts when local files have been modified (e.g. by `chmod +x`); `reset --hard` always succeeds
- 📦 `fix:` Playwright updated using `$VENV_DIR/bin/playwright` full path — the bare `playwright` command is unreliable in zsh after venv activation
- 🏷️ `fix:` Banner updated from "CONTINENTE CART BOT" to "CONTINENTE HERO"

---

#### `README.md` — complete v2 rewrite

- 🚀 `feat:` `shop` alias documented as the primary entry point
- 🗂️ `feat:` Multi-config usage guide — `configs/` folder, switching, creating new lists
- 🔐 `feat:` Session connection deep-dive — cookie anatomy table, full flow diagram, security notes
- ⚠️ `feat:` Python 3.14 incompatibility explained with the exact compiler error
- 🛠️ `feat:` Full "how it works" section — browser engine, product resolution strategy, failover guarantee, run report format
- 🏷️ `feat:` Version badge updated to 2.0.0, links to GitHub Releases
